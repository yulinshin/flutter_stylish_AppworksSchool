Encounter the "INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE" error, Stop the emulator in the Android Studio AVD Manager, wipe data, and increase the internal storage.

To add image assets, create a folder "assets/images" in the project, and add the following to the pubspec.yaml file:
```
flutter:
assets:
- assets/images
```
